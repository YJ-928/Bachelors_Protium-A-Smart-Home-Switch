## Abstract
Internet of Things is composed of things that have unique identities and are connected to each other over internet. It is simply connecting and monitoring various devices and sensors through 
Internet. This paved the way for home automation and monitoring which makes human life more comfortable and secured. This paper describes the overall notion of the IOT based sensing 
systems and monitoring systems for implementing an automated home. The proposed prototype uses Node MCU board with internet being remotely controlled by Android OS smart phone. 
Node MCU is the heart of this system and it can perform as a micro web server and it acts as an interface for the wide range of hardware modules. To control lights, fans and other home 
appliances which are connected to the relay system, the system offers switching functionalities. It is also used for environmental monitoring by sensing and analyzing data about temperature 
and humidity. Another notifying feature in this system designed is the intrusion detection which is offered by this system using motion sensor. All these activities are controlled by using 
Android mobile app-Blynk.

## INTRODUCTION
The internet of things, or IOT, is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) 
and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or humanto-computer interaction. The IOT devices have the capacity to exchange the contents depending upon the control of function in a specified manner. The benefit of IOT networks is that they can separate and create information by designating, filtering, handling and extracting the data. The authorities predicted that by the year 2020, around 50 billion devices 
have internet connection . One of the major sides of IOT is a smart home. The era of neverending growth of the internet and its application, smart home system or home automation system is highly increasing to provide comfort in life and improving the quality of life. The main objective of this smart home system is to make human life easy and comfortable by using IOT. Now a day as people are so busy with their work pressure so the will be looking 
for a smarter life style. Home automation or domotics is building automation for a home, called a smart home or smart house. A home automation system will control lighting, climate, entertainment systems, and appliances. It may also include home security such as access control and alarm systems. A home automation system typically connects controlled devices to a central hub.
